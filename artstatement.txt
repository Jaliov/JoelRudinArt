I create mystical dream images, places of peace in troubled times, in transparent pastels, in veiled, muted colors, evoking the faded look of old color photos and early Technicolor films, fleeting images that pass one by in a dream or vision, half recognized or understood, as when drifting off to sleep, an intangible, other world lurking beyond the façade of the everyday. I am inspired by nature and my practice of tai chi. This, coupled with a desire for solace in the midst of personal loss, led to the work I do today, perhaps all foreshadowed when as a child my sixth grade teacher, sympathetic to my art leanings, assigned me to create an image of our solar system in color chalks across the classroom blackboard. No photo of the finished “masterpiece” exists, an ephemeral cosmic image in pigmented dust
