# JoelRudinArt

### This site is an extensive reboot of an website I first created in 2012 as a showcase for my work as a visual artist

### It has been updated with more modern technologies and for the first time made responsive for different sized devices

### Featured are my ethereal, imaginary landscapes I call "Cosmic Visions".
